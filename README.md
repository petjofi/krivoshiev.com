Hello, my name is Petar Krivoshiev. 

I have been an Entrepreneur, Software Developer and Project Manager with more then 15 years experience in the field.

## Philosophy

Don't just write code, solve problems instead!

## Technology

### My Favourite Setup
Currently I love working with Python, Django, Node, PHP and Angular2. Jira and Git are priceless.

### Mostly Used
I have gathered experience with a lot of different technologies but mostly with PHP, VB.NET, Javascript, 
AngularJS, SQL. Working in the machine industry in Germany told me how to use all kind of tools efficiently
and to deliver fast a qualitative solutions.

### Others
I learned to use Java for some Android projects, Objective-C for a couple of iOS application and
started with Swift with my colleges at Codeberry when it first came up. We decided to build our application in Swift, 
when it was still in beta, to be able to answer our client's needs for the time it will become stable.


## Story
I was born in the small town of Asenovgrad, Bulgaria. My interest in technology originates as long as i can remember.
One of my earliest memories is when my grandfather brought me to a small room in the Building he worked.
There i saw Pravetz 8 for the first time. It was our "nations pride" product, copy of the legendary Apple-I and II.
Back then it was not easy to get access to such an amazing thing. So when i had the possibility to go to the 
High School of Mathematics i did not hesitate. I was in an experimental class for the youngest and 
we had a lot of fun with one of the earliest computers and robots.

I still can not explain why couple of years later my father decided to bye me a personal computer. It was such an expensive
thing. Bulgaria was entering democracy and the crisis was widespread. My 286XT costed a fortune - more then a normal car.
But that way i had the miracle right at home and next to playing games i was getting familiar with Basic, Pascal and 
even Delphi.

The next couple of years were quite busy. I entered the german language school and finished with average. 
Languages were not my strong side. Years later I will be very thankful to my german teachers for there patience.
Now, after fifteen years in Germany I am proud to speak an excellent german and I love it. At the end I was more involved
with developing an alternative to the civil education then with my german lessons.
 
After finishing high school I went to the Plovdiv University with major Engineering Physics. But then a surprising 
possibility arose and I started my first private business - an advertising agency with the name 
"Triad of the United Futures Arts" (TUFA). Remembering the name after twenty years still makes me smile. So began my
carrier in the entrepreneurship. It was clear quite fast that without the full commitment and a lot of risk and money it
will probably fail. And so it does.

At that time I was already busy finding my way out of Bulgaria and after a short carrier as an IT Administrator I bought
my first ticket to Berlin, Germany. It was an amazing place. The Physics Department had a brand new library with more
then hundred modern computers, compared to our 4 old school PCs it was like traveling in time. I wandered between lectures
in quantum physics and short-term student jobs until one day I met my future friends at Jonas & Redmann. It is a leading
german industry automation company specialising in building machines for the solar sector. Started with small 
contract jobs I soon saw an opportunity to make a huge optimisation at the logistics department. I started with a simple 
stock module mirroring there existing logic. Optimised and documented the process and developed a sophisticated method
to search for existing parts in a huge database. Our machines was client specific, but most of the parts were redundant.
The possibility to use the data - how often a single part is used - gave us the benefit over the competition. We were able
to meet a ridiculous deadlines. With the support of my manager we soon had a fast growing self-made planning tool covering
Finance, Purchase, Sales, Engineering, Distribution.
